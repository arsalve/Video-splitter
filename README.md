# Video-splitter
This is an simple python script for splitting videos based on thier length.
Usefull for automatically split video into smaller chunks so they can be uploaded on platforms where there is limit of video length.

I used this script for making chunks of large video and then manually upload those chunks on what's app status in bulk.

I think it is faster and easier way to upload large video on what's app status.

I have tried to upload entire first part of movie on what's app status and i have succeeded.(ideas where born from necessities)
